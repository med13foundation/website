Vision
A world where every individual with MED13 syndrome reaches their full potential through accelerated research, accessible treatments, and comprehensive support.
Mission
The MED13 Foundation unites families, researchers, and clinicians to:
Build a comprehensive patient registry and biorepository to accelerate scientific discovery
Fund and facilitate research toward treatments and a cure for MED13 syndrome
Support families through their diagnostic journey and beyond
Raise awareness and understanding of MED13-related neurodevelopmental disorders
Who We Are
Our Story
The MED13 Foundation was established by families directly affected by MED13 syndrome, one of the rarest neurodevelopmental disorders with just over 51 identified patients worldwide. Following the first comprehensive characterization of MED13 syndrome in 2018, our community recognized the urgent need for organized advocacy and research infrastructure.
As parents navigating this ultra-rare diagnosis, we understand the isolation, uncertainty, and determination that defines this journey. We've witnessed our children's struggles with speech, learning, and development – but also their incredible resilience and unique personalities that shine through every challenge.
Our Community
51+ families worldwide connected through shared experience
Researchers and clinicians pioneering understanding of the Mediator complex
Advocates and allies committed to improving outcomes for all individuals with neurodevelopmental differences
Our Approach
We're building on proven models from related conditions, particularly learning from the MED13L Foundation's eight-year journey from support group to clinical trial readiness. By joining forces with established infrastructure through COMBINEDBrain and leveraging shared resources, we can accelerate progress despite our small numbers.
