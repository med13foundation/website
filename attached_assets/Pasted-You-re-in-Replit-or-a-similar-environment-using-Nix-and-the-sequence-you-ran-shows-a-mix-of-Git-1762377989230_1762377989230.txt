You’re in Replit (or a similar environment using Nix), and the sequence you ran shows **a mix of Git setup issues** plus a small environment confusion. Let’s break it down clearly:

---

### 🧩 What Happened Step-by-Step

1. **Initial Status**

   ```
   git status
   ```

   → Shows you’re on `main` and have an untracked `README.md`.
   ✅ Normal — means the file is new and not yet staged.

2. **You tried `git add .`**

   ```
   fatal: Unable to create '/home/runner/workspace/.git/index.lock': File exists.
   ```

   → Git creates a temporary “lock file” (`.git/index.lock`) during operations.
   If a prior Git process (e.g., a commit, add, or merge) crashed, this file remains and prevents new operations.

   ✅ Solution:

   ```
   rm -f .git/index.lock
   ```

   Then rerun:

   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit worked fine afterward**

   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit..."
   ```

   → ✅ Your commit succeeded.

4. **Then you ran `remote add origin ...`**

   ```
   remote add origin https://github.com/me13foundation/website.git
   ```

   ❌ Problem: you typed `remote add` instead of `git remote add`.

   The terminal tried to execute a command named `remote`, not a `git` subcommand.
   Replit’s environment found a program called `remote-exec` via Nix and tried to install it — but that’s unrelated.

   ✅ Correct command:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/me13foundation/website.git
   ```

5. **Next, `git branch -M main` failed**

   ```
   error: could not lock config file .git/config
   fatal: branch is renamed, but update of config-file failed
   ```

   → This is another lock issue. Likely, `.git/config.lock` exists because a previous Git command was interrupted.

   ✅ Fix:

   ```bash
   rm -f .git/config.lock
   git branch -M main
   ```

---

### ✅ Correct Fix and Push Sequence

Run these commands exactly, in order:

```bash
# 1. Clean up old lock files
rm -f .git/index.lock
rm -f .git/config.lock

# 2. Verify your branch
git status

# 3. Ensure README.md is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: MED13 Foundation website"

# 4. Set up remote correctly
git remote add origin https://github.com/me13foundation/website.git

# 5. Ensure branch name
git branch -M main

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls in Replit

* Replit sometimes keeps Git processes open when you use the built-in Git GUI — causing `.lock` files.
* Always use `git` commands in the shell, **not** the Replit sidebar buttons, for complex operations.
* If you get errors like “Cannot resolve the remote workspace,” that’s a Replit integration bug; it’s safe to ignore if you’re only pushing to GitHub manually.

Would you like me to give you a **one-line script** to safely reset all Git locks and reinitialize the remote (so you can just paste it and fix everything)?
